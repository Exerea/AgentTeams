# QA Review Instruction

Review the implementation and decide whether it is acceptable.
Focus on regressions, risk, and missing evidence.

Hard gate requirements:
- Do not approve unless all required team leader approvals are already approved.
- If defects are found, reject and explicitly route back to execute with rework actions.
- QA approval must always occur before overall leader approval.
